# GamePlan for Twitch IRC MCP Server

This document outlines the implementation plan for building a Twitch IRC MCP-compatible server. The project is broken down into logical branches and tasks, with each task having a priority level, description, and steps to complete.

## Branch 1: Project Setup and Base Structure
### Task 1.1: Initialize Project Structure (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** Establishes the foundation for the entire project with proper configuration, dependencies, and structure.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Initialize npm project with `npm init`
- [ ] Create folder structure (src/, bin/, test/)
- [ ] Add essential dependencies (tmi.js, json-rpc-2.0, commander.js, express, dotenv)
- [ ] Create TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- [ ] Setup ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [ ] Configure gitignore and environment variable templates
- [ ] Create basic README documentation

**Notes:** Setting up TypeScript from the beginning ensures type safety throughout development and helps catch errors early.

### Task 1.2: Setup Environment Configuration (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** Enables secure handling of credentials and configuration, separating them from code.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Create .env.example file with required variables
- [ ] Implement environment variable loading with dotenv
- [ ] Add validation for required environment variables 
- [ ] Create configuration module for accessing variables throughout the app
- [ ] Document environment setup process in README

**Notes:** Proper environment variable handling is critical for security and deployment flexibility.

## Branch 2: Twitch IRC Client Implementation
### Task 2.1: Implement Twitch IRC Client (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** Core functionality depends on the Twitch connection; this component will handle the actual chat interactions.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Create TwitchClient class using tmi.js
- [ ] Implement connection with auth from environment variables
- [ ] Add channel join/leave functionality
- [ ] Create event handlers for messages and other events
- [ ] Implement message sending functionality
- [ ] Add reconnection handling logic
- [ ] Create in-memory message storage system

**Notes:** The IRC client is the backbone of the application; robust error handling and reconnection logic are essential.

### Task 2.2: Implement Message Storage (Priority: Medium)
**Why it's important:** Enables history features and filtering without requiring external databases.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Design message storage data structure
- [ ] Implement message recording on receive
- [ ] Add timestamp and metadata to stored messages
- [ ] Create retrieval methods with pagination
- [ ] Implement filtering by user, content, and time
- [ ] Add message pruning to prevent memory issues
- [ ] Create methods for full message history export

**Notes:** While in-memory storage is simpler, consider size limitations and performance implications for high-volume channels.

## Branch 3: CLI Interface
### Task 3.1: Create Command-Line Interface (Priority: Medium)
**Why it's important:** Provides a user-friendly way to interact with the tool directly from the terminal.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Set up Commander.js for CLI parsing
- [ ] Implement 'send' command for messages
- [ ] Implement 'join' command for channel switching
- [ ] Add 'read' command for message retrieval
- [ ] Create 'filter' command with multiple criteria
- [ ] Implement 'all' command for full history
- [ ] Add help documentation for all commands
- [ ] Create executable entry point

**Notes:** The CLI should be intuitive with helpful error messages and documentation.

### Task 3.2: Implement Server Mode (Priority: Medium)
**Why it's important:** Allows the tool to run as a persistent process rather than one-off commands.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Create server mode entry point
- [ ] Implement persistent Twitch connection
- [ ] Add signal handling for graceful shutdown
- [ ] Create logging for server events
- [ ] Add optional file logging configuration

**Notes:** Server mode is essential for the MCP functionality and should handle crashes and reconnections gracefully.

## Branch 4: MCP JSON-RPC Implementation (STDIO)
### Task 4.1: Set Up JSON-RPC over STDIO (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** Core functionality for LLM integration via the Model Context Protocol.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement STDIO input/output handling
- [ ] Create JSON-RPC message parser/serializer
- [ ] Set up method dispatcher for incoming requests
- [ ] Implement error handling per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec
- [ ] Add initialize method support
- [ ] Add standard MCP lifecycle handling

**Notes:** Following the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification exactly is important for compatibility.

### Task 4.2: Implement MCP Tool Methods (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** These are the actual functions that LLMs will call to interact with Twitch chat.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement tools/list method with full manifest
- [ ] Create tools/call method to dispatch to functions
- [ ] Implement sendMessage tool
- [ ] Implement joinChannel tool
- [ ] Add getRecentMessages tool
- [ ] Create filterMessages tool
- [ ] Implement getAllMessages tool
- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation for all tools

**Notes:** Tools should have clear, concise descriptions and validation to help LLMs use them correctly.

## Branch 5: MCP HTTP Server Implementation
### Task 5.1: Create HTTP Server for MCP (Priority: Medium)
**Why it's important:** Provides an alternative interface for tools that prefer HTTP over STDIO.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Set up Express server
- [ ] Implement manifest endpoint
- [ ] Create JSON-RPC call endpoint
- [ ] Add CORS and security headers
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add optional authentication
- [ ] Create documentation for HTTP endpoints

**Notes:** While STDIO is the primary MCP interface, HTTP support increases compatibility with more tools.

### Task 5.2: Implement WebSocket Support (Priority: Low)
**Why it's important:** Allows real-time updates without polling for certain integrations.

**Steps:**
- [ ] Add WebSocket server
- [ ] Implement connection handling
- [ ] Create message subscription system
- [ ] Add channel-specific subscriptions
- [ ] Implement reconnection handling
- [ ] Document WebSocket API

**Notes:** This is a lower priority but adds value for real-time integrations.

## Branch 6: Testing and Documentation
### Task 6.1: Implement Testing (Priority: High)
**Why it's important:** Ensures reliability and makes future changes safer.

**Steps:**

**Steps:**
- [ ] Implement metrics collection
- [ ] Add timing for performance tracking
- [ ] Create usage statistics
- [ ] Implement optional telemetry
- [ ] Add dashboard or reporting interface
- [ ] Document metrics system

**Notes:** Analytics are valuable for troubleshooting and optimization but not core functionality.

## Implementation Strategy

The branches are organized in order of dependency and priority. The recommended implementation order is:

1. Project Setup (Branch 1)
2. Twitch IRC Client (Branch 2)
3. MCP JSON-RPC Implementation (Branch 4)
4. CLI Interface (Branch 3)
5. Testing (Branch 6.1)
6. MCP HTTP Server (Branch 5)
7. Documentation (Branch 6.2)
8. Packaging (Branch 7)
9. Advanced Features (Branch 8)

This order ensures that core functionality is implemented first, with additional features added once the foundation is solid. Testing should be integrated throughout the development process, not just at the end.

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:

1. The Twitch IRC client can connect, receive, and send messages
2. The MCP JSON-RPC interface is fully implemented (both STDIO and HTTP)
3. All core tools (sendMessage, joinChannel, getRecentMessages, filterMessages, getAllMessages) work correctly
4. The CLI interface provides all essential commands
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. Tests cover all critical functionality
7. The package can be installed and run via npm

Advanced features are considered enhancements and not required for the initial release.
